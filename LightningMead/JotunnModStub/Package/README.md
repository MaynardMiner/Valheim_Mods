I know it works, the tooltips and the descriptions are rough as I am still trying to figure out Jotunn localization. It works as any other mead- You must first make the base which is 10 Honey, 2 Thunderstone, and 4 Crystal. See github for codebase. I will publish my own repo- This is alpha test version learning how to use Jotunn. This was designed to be used with/proof of concept for Journey to Valhalla Modpack.
