# Valheim Mods
Repository for mods I have created for Valheim.

# LightningMead
This is a mod that creates a lightning resistance mead, which I found is very useful for other mods/modpacks. Lightning Resistance Mead Base requires a level 4 cauldron to create. The ingredients are as followed:

```
10 Honey
4 Crystal
2 Thunderstone
```

## Install:

-Install BepInEx.
-Install Jotunn modpack.
-Download .zip files, and extract. Place the contents of the plugins folder into the BepInEx/plugins directory.
-Enjoy

## Changelog

0.0.1: Alpha version
0.0.2: Added localization (Thanks to TheDefSide), Moved to a new repository.
